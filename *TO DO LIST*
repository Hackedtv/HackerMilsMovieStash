2) Anway to add ENG SUB files to a link? 
  yes we can but is it nessesary when we have xbmc subtitle plugin, its pretty much full proof
-> oh wow i didnt even know about that.. dont kno if others will know about it either ... is it automatic?
if it is coo .. if not would rather the viewer not have to do anything .. specifically im talking about that movie 
"The Grandmaster" its in chinese only but i have the eng sub file here .. let me know


*Please either tell me how to execute any of these, or delete from here if you have done it on your side* 

PS.. Anything else you might need from me put here I'll check daily and get it done :)
